# RoadFuelGo

Fuel consumption is increasing due to the growth of automobiles in the market. Unfortunately, if the vehicle stalls due to lack of fuel, for some reason people need to push a car or get help to reach the nearest gas station. In the above steps, the vehicle owner spends time and manual work. It becomes even more difficult for some older people and those who are medically ill. The application provides door-to-door delivery of fuel. The advantage of using this system is that the end user can choose the type of fuel they need, order and receive the fuel, and simplify the userâ€™s process. This is an Android application that uses Android Studio as an IDE. Java is used for coding and XML is used for user interface design. The result of the project will be an Android application that allows customers to order fuel. Customers can also find out the availability of all gas stations nearby.
